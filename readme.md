# Zusamme gugge
Zusamme gugge is a german/hessisch term for watch together. 

Inspired by the desire to watch movies together on a couch (without moveing too much)

* Simply build and start the gugge executable. All client's can now connect to you (port: 7787).
* Set voice to be the voice leader (who's controling the video). The other client's will synchronize with you.
* Set no me sync, to forbid other client's to control your video.

## For better zusamme gugge experience
* seek with your mousepointer to the desired location
* wait a moment
* release your mousebutton. 
* enjoy "perfect" syncronisation ;)

It's good enough to watch startrek :)
